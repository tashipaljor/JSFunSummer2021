## Course Description

Prepare yourself for the world of web applications. This beginner to intermediate level course teaches the fundamentals of JavaScript, building a solid foundation in the language. The goal is that when you finish this class, you are ready to learn React, Angular, Vue.js and other frameworks. We will begin with the very basics of programming and common JavaScript “gotchas” (e.g. scope, shallow cloning vs deep cloning, and _this_ keyword). We will learn how to solve algorithms with features such as callbacks, closures and high order functions. Then we will explore how to make your applications come alive in the browser, how to communicate with a remote server, and finally, how to organize your code.

This course will also introduce you to the tools and practice of the trade. This includes working with command line, building your code, package management, version control with git, unit testing, and Scrum methodology. We usually have guest speakers from local software development firms. This class will give you an opportunity to meet employers and contacts within the capital region.

## Class Policies

### Class Format & Communications

The class will be taught over Microsoft Team's video conferencing. AlbanyCanCode adminstration will give you access and provide training over Microsoft Teams. Please contact either John Sturman or another member of the administrative team for technical support.

Most of the communication outside of class will take place on Slack. Please check it regularly. The class’s public channel is _#jsfun-summer-2021_.

### Grading

In order to receive a certificate of completion, you must follow the conditions of your Student Learning Contract. You must attend at least 75% of classes and you must submit 80% of your work. However, we are willing to be flexible in special circumstances. Please contact the program director and your instructors _as soon as possible_ if something serious is preventing you from participating or submitting your work.

#### Projects

There will be two projects:

**First Project** \
Due: TBA, halfway through the class \
You can resubmit this project for a better grade, as long as you meet the following requirements: 1) you submit something by due date, even if it is not complete 2.) you resubmit by the last day of class.

**Final Project** \
Due: TBA \
This project will be made publicly accessible. We will have a virtual graduation, where you project will be shown to employers within the community.

If you do not turn in your projects, you may not receive a certificate of completion.

### Assignments

In addition to your projects, you will be completing in-class and take-home assignments. While you will not be graded on these assignments, we encourage that you do your assignments for your personal benefit. We will ask you to submit your work through GitHub pull requests so that we can view your progress.

### Getting Help

If you find that you have any trouble keeping up with assignments, technology or other aspects of the course, make sure you let AlbanyCanCode know as early as possible. As you will find, building rapport and effective relationships are key to becoming an effective professional.

While Jamal and Matina would like to help you any way we can, your instructors do have full-time jobs outside of this class and are not always available. We encourage you to message the class channel or ask other students for help. Our staff are also available for 1-on-1 help sessions.

If you have a disability and would like to request accommodations, please contact the instructors during the first week of the semester so that your accommodations may be provided in a timely manner.

### Dropping the Class

If you must drop the course, please contact Annmarie Lanesey at annmarie@albanycancode.org and notify the instructors.
